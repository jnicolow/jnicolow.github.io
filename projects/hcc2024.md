I had the opportunity to present my poster titled "A Machine Learning Method for Detecting Fog in Mountain Trail Camera Images" at the 2024 Hawaiʻi Conservation Conference. It was a great experience attending inspiring talks and meeting Hawaiʻi's brilliant conservation field!

I was honored to be awarded the 'Outstanding Undergraduate Student Poster Presentation' award!
