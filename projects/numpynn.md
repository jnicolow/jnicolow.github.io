summary: "Neural Network Implemented in Numpy and Trained/Evaluated on MNIST"
---
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network and gradient descent written in numpy. The implementation was trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset to attain test accuracy of 94.6%. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 examples of handwritten digits. The handwritten digits are represented by 28x28 pixel grayscale images. For this experiment, 50,00 examples were used for training, 5,000 for validations, and 15,000 for testing.
